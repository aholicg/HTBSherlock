```bash
Task 8
What is the TLSH of the malware?
```
Wrong hash, wrong TLSH, VirtusTotal detected my script.ahk as script.ahk.txt T.T (I only deleted the content inside comments)
Oh, after downloading the original `jvtobaqj` file and looking through it again, the random words were commented out, not the main script (of course LOL). Did not touch the file at all -> VirusTotal -> correct detection
You were not supposed to make any change on the original malware.

What is even TLSH again???

```bash
Task 9
What is the name given to this malware? Use the name used by McAfee, Ikarus, and alejandro.sanchez.
```
Scroll down under tab `Detection of VirtusTotal` -> `Security vendors' analysis`

```bash
Task 10
What is the user-agent string of the infected machine?
```
By using `find a packet` with option `Packet detail` & `String` `User-Agent` there appeared to be only one infected machine but how do we know how many machines again??/
